==========

## Why this team

The purpose we created team `nx503a-dev` is: to maintain a generic, working device configuration that can be easily port to popular Android projects for the device `nx503a`.

## Maintaining ports

We are keeping the device working on the Android 6.0 branch of these AOSP-based projects.

Other ports are also planned, such as OmniROM (and TWRP of course).
